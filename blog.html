            <h2>Our Certificate and Online Programs For 2023</h2>
            <p>This is an interdisciplinary programme with the objective of producing graduates of high caliber to meet the emerging challenges in the field of energy and environment. Candidates with a Degree in Chemical, Mechanical, 
                Electrical Engineering or Biotechnology are eligible to join the course. 
                The course deals with energy efficiency, energy services, environmental compliance and alternative energy technologies. Energy engineering is 
                one of the more recent engineering disciplines to emerge. Energy engineers apply their skills to increase efficiency and further develop renewable sources of energy. 
                The main job of energy engineers is to find the most efficient and sustainable ways to operate buildings and manufacturing processes. 
                Energy engineers audit the use of energy in those processes and suggest ways to improve the systems. This means suggesting advanced lighting, better insulation, more efficient heating and cooling properties of buildings.
                 The M. Tech programme is of four semesters, comprising two semesters of course work and two semesters of project work. Admission to this programme is based on the scores in the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE).</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>On completion of M. Tech (Energy Engg.) program, the student will be able to,

                    Acquire in depth knowledge to design, analyze and evaluate the performance of Renewable and Non-renewable energy/environmental systems considering Indian and global perspective and integrate the knowledge obtained for enhancing the efficiency.
                    Analyze critically the increase in energy demand supply gap with time, potential of renewable/ non-renewable energy sources, technology gaps, implementation issues for synthesizing information to make intellectual and creative advances in the fields of energy technologies, for conducting research in a wider theoretical, practical and policy context.
                    Quantify the emission from various sources by conducting energy audit for process / engineering industries and building sector using appropriate measurements and evaluate a wide range of potential solutions at feasible and optimal solutions through energy efficient devices/ independent or hybrid renewable energy systems considering public health and safety, cultural, societal and environmental factors. 
                    Extract information pertinent to design, conversion, storage, utilization of renewable/ nonrenewable energy systems through literature survey and experiments, apply appropriate research methodologies, techniques and tools, design, conduct experiments, analyse and interpret data, demonstrate higher order skills and view things in a broader perspective, contribute individually/in group(s) to the enhancement of scientific/technological knowledge in the fields of renewable/ nonrenewable energy engineering.
                    Apply software skills in the field of modelling, analysis and system simulation such as MATLAB, ANSY- CFX, Fluent, HOMER, RSM, TRNSYS, PV-SYST, SOLAR PRO, ENERGY PLUS for performance evaluation and optimization of nonrenewable/ renewable energy systems like bio, wind, solar and hybrid systems.
                    Recognize opportunities and contribute positively to collaborative multidisciplinary scientific research, demonstrate a capacity for self-management and teamwork, with open mindedness, to achieve common goals in providing solutions for energy demand/environmental related problems and further the learning for themselves as well as others. 
                    Demonstrate the knowledge on energy conservation/ renewable energy projects after considering the economic factors by understanding engineering, management principles and apply the same to manage projects efficiently in multidisciplinary environments as a member and leader in a team. 
                    Communicate with the engineering community, and with society at large, regarding energy engineering activities confidently and effectively, such as, being able to comprehend and write effective reports and design documentation by adhering to appropriate standards, make effective presentations, and give and receive clear instructions.
                    Recognize the need for lifelong learning independently, with a high level of enthusiasm and commitment to improve knowledge and competence continuously. 
                    Acquire professional and intellectual integrity, professional code of conduct, ethics of research and scholarship, consideration of the impact of research outcomes in energy engineering professional practices and an understanding of responsibility to contribute to the community for sustainable development of society. 
                    Observe and examine critically the outcomes of oneâ€™s actions and make corrective measures subsequently, and learn from mistakes without depending on external feedback. 
                    Design one system for renewable energy/ Energy efficient system and make project report for its concept to implementation based on learnings above.</p>
